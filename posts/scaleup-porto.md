by ABEL COENTRÃO Público 16/12/2015 **_ScaleUp Porto_ presented itself to the city announcing a major conference to launch the initiative, similar to the European model, with new spaces in the downtown for projects that need to gain ground.** By the middle of next year, the downtown of Porto will have four thousand square meters of re-qualified spaces for the installation of newly established companies who need increased space. This will be one of the first visible consequences of the scheme _[ScaleUp Porto](http://www.scaleupporto.pt/)_, which was presented on Wednesday by its founding partners. The city joined the University - through [Uptec, Science and Technology Park](http://uptec.up.pt/en) and the [Porto Business School](https://www.pbs.up.pt/?page_id=147) - the [Polytechnic](https://www.ipp.pt/) and the [National Innovation Agency](http://aninov.pt/), in a consortium that aims to create an environment and provide tools to help the hundreds of startups generated within these and other institutions to thrive in the international market. There are many examples in Porto of companies created in the city which have already climbed several levels to become known internationally. Veniam, which develops vehicle network data transmission in an urban environment, is just one of the recent cases from a list that includes Kinematix, Blip, Uniplaces, AdClick, Nonius Software, Mog Technologies, Gema, and Movvo, amongst others. But their success hides the difficulties that they encountered and the anxieties that prevent others from following a similar path. These often start with the lack of skills in areas such as management (something that can help an entrepreneur to become a business person, as was highlighted in the presentation of Porto ScaleUp strategy). Another problem that faces any Startup is obviously the funding of the new business. Although the situation has improved, the country does not seem to have sufficient resources or attention. And the consortium ScaleUp Porto wants to help to attract the interest of many international sources of investment. So already in May of next year it is organizing the conference _ScaleUp For Europe_. While serving as a launch for a European initiative to promote the maturation of innovative business projects, involving from this first moment cities like Manchester, Eindhoven and Helsinki and a national-level body in the United Kingdom, the _ScaleUp Institute_, a three day initiative, will bring potential investors to Porto. _ScaleUp for Europe_ will coincide with the annual conference of the [European Businness Angels Network (EBAN)](http://www.eban.org/), which also takes place in Porto. And the councilor with responsibility for innovation, Filipe Araújo, said that the city will take advantage of this stage (and the showcase that is _ScaleUp Porto_), to show investors from various countries the entrepreneurial potential, and businesses in gestation and maturation in Porto. The figures that have been released are telling. _Uptec_ alone has helped 164 business projects to be born and has supported the graduation of 32 companies that have created an estimated 1,800 skilled jobs and contributed 70 million euros in gross domestic product. In the new spaces to be created in Porto's downtown there will be room for 300 workers. And they are welcome because _Uptec_ has already had some difficulty, despite the large investment in facilities, to accommodate all who apply for a small space to kick-start a new project. With the departure of companies capable of "scaling up", others may take their place in the various branches of the park around Porto. Meanwhile, the association Founders to Founders, which brings together companies born in this ecosystem and who have gone to another level, have still other structures, public and private, to help those who want to start a new business. The _ScaleUp Porto_ strategy is one of the political pledges of the council, who had been working on the project for about a year and a half. In this way, the city council led by Rui Moreira intends to internationally position Porto as an open space for creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, attracting not only potential future entrepreneurs, but also established companies and, of course, potential funders. The audience of the meeting this afternoon, also highlighted the need to attract talent, including the realization of a roadshow to foreign universities. Councilor Philip Araújo expects that the manifesto of _ScaleUp Porto_, presented on Wednesday, can organize the city and stakeholders to offer hundreds of new companies the tools - such as training, integration in international networks, contact with investors and customers - to allow them to make the leap to the next level. There is an awareness that this will represent an increase in job creation and a new focus for urban renewal. Porto has been in the news for the tourism boom and the rehabilitation of buildings for this sector, but it needs to diversify the uses of the buildings, to attract businesses and new residents. In this way the city itself can gain scale. translated from Portuguese source: [http://www.publico.pt/local/noticia/nasceu-o-scaleup-porto-um-consorcio-para-dar-escala-a-empresas-recemcriadas-1717678?page=1#/follow](http://www.publico.pt/local/noticia/nasceu-o-scaleup-porto-um-consorcio-para-dar-escala-a-empresas-recemcriadas-1717678?page=1#/follow)
