[_Habitar Portugal 12-14_](http://www.habitarportugal.org), takes a look at the Portuguese architectural production of the last three years (works completed between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014). It investigates the impacts and influences of austerity on the architectural output, believing that it must have had a profound effect on construction and architecture in the years 2012 to 2014. The theme of this edition of Habitar Portugal - _Is architecture being held to ransom?_ - provided the context for a pre-selection stage which included more than 400 works. It is not considered a prize for architectural excellence, but an award that highlights the unique nature of each of the choices and how they represent the current reality. The final selection includes 70 works distributed throughout Portugal, with a further 10 constructed by Portuguese architects abroad. HP 12-14 edition, will include 14 exhibitions by the end of 2017. The first takes place in the Galeria Municipal do Porto (Jardins do Palácio de Cristal), in association with the City of Porto, and is inaugurated on 18 February at 19.00 and runs until April 25, 2016. A parallel program will include presentations by the authors of the selected works located in the Porto Metropolitan Area, debates, a film series, a program of guided tours and an educational service. There is also plans to redesign the project's [website](http://www.habitarportugal.org,) to display the works of the HP 12-14 selection and of all the previous editions. As part of the exhibition a selection of films will be screened, from April 6 - 8, in the auditorium of the Almeida Garrett Library: **Wednesday, 6 of April, 7pm: A Comparação em Obra/ Performing Comparison** Zwei Museen \[Two Museums\] (Alemanha/EUA/Israel 2013, Heinz Emigholz, 18 min) Zum Vergleich \[In Comparison\] (Alemanha, 2009, Harun Farocki, 61 min) **Thursday, 7 of April, 7pm: A Cidade Enquanto Estaleiro / The City As Construction Site** En Construcción \[Under construction\] (Espanha, 2001, José Luis Guerín, 125 min) **Friday, 8 of April, 7pm: Viagens no Tempo / Travels in Time** This is a History of New York \[Isto é uma História de Nova Iorque\] (EUA, 1988, Jem Cohen, 23 min Ruínas (Portugal, 2009, Manuel Mozoz, 60 min)
