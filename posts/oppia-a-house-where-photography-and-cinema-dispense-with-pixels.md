Anyone who likes Pinhole, à la minute photography or films in Super8mm will be able to go there as early as this Wednesday, at 228, Rua Barão de São Cosme, not far from the Campo 24 de Agosto and the Faculty of Fine Arts. Cristiano Pereira has already traveled with his wares, to European universities, to show films in Super8 and 16 mm made in Porto, to the astonishment of foreign students and teachers. Those were the days of classes at [ESAP](http://www.esap.pt/en/) (Escola Superior Artística do Porto), where he studied film and theater and where he began to make Pinholes, a technique which he perfected with mastery. It is therefore one of the first two exhibitions to open in his OPPIA - _Sol à Sombre_ - which shows recognizable landscapes by those who frequent the city or are returning after nearly a decade of giving classes in Terras de Basto. The OPPIA occupies two floors - and the terrace - of a a common house on the street Barão de São Cosme. In the absence of any flashy neon to alert the passersby, the film curtain, decorating the ground floor window of no. 228, tells us without doubt. It's there. Inside, a large box camera rests from a summer, spent in the Ribeira de Gaia, delighting tourists and grandparents with its "à la minute" photos. It will now serve for training purposes in this technique, which Cristiano Pereira will host in the academy without the tricks he once saw in Brazil, where a huge box concealed inside, a digital camera and a printer. In a city with several locations, such as _[Câmaras e Companhia](http://camarasecompanhia.com/)_, the _[Máquinas de Outros Tempos](http://maquinasdeoutrostempos.com/)_ and the _[Sítio do Cano Amarelo](http://www.sitiodocanoamarelo.com/)_ and the current trend in "analog" photography and in movies in formats such as 8mm or Super8, Cristiano Pereira also want to explore the historical links of Porto to these forms of expression. Was it not Porto, he insists, that was one of the first cities in the world where people started filming - thanks to Aurélio da Paz dos Reis, who in 1896 recorded the _Saída dos Operários da Fábrica Confiança_ (The exit of the workers from the Confiança Factory) 750 meters away, in Rua de Santa Catarina. In Porto, he adds, there were in these days, excellent photography houses, led by Domingos Alvão, in this same shopping street, and the German Emilio Biel, who occupied the Palácio do Bolhão in Rua Formosa, now rehabilitated by the _[Academia Contemporânea do Espectáculo](http://ace-tb.com/)_. Cristiano Pereira has also given life to historic buildings. A decade ago he took to _Batalha_ - one of the great houses of modern architecture and film in Porto, currently closed - his International Festival of Super8mm Cinema, the Douro Film Festival. That will now be held in the OPPIA, with transmissions over the internet. At the academy, every two weeks and on Saturday, there will be film screenings in that format, taking advantage of an extensive archive that has accumulated over the years. The founder hopes to stimulate in the space a taste for family home movie sessions, authentic relics of private and social life, from the Porto of yesteryear. The proximity of the _[Faculty of Fine Arts](http://www.fba.up.pt)_, the re-population of the area surrounding the OPPIA, which he continues to notice, and the tourist boom that the city is experiencing, justify in part this venture for Cristiano Pereira, who a few years ago organized super8mm sessions in neighborhood bars and cafes, illuminating the nights of many people. He also knows there's an audience, albeit niche, for the forms of making photography and cinema that he wants to explore here. For the coming year, he promises specific events centered around the [_World Day of Pinhole Photography_](http://pinholeday.org/) (April 24), the _[World Photography Day](http://worldphotoday.com)_ (August 19th) and the [World Super8mm Day](http://www.gs8d2015.com/), on October 24th, a date that will mark the return of the _Douro Film Festival,_ and an event of sequential projections in several countries. The adventure begins on Wednesday with the opening at the _Galeria Lua_, of his pinholes, _Sol à Sombra_, and in another part of the space, which he calls _Galeria Sol_ of _Os Retratos dos Poetas das Quintas de Leitura por Pat_, of Patrícia Vieira Campos, at 18.30. Then, the screen will descend for the first film projections. Whoever comes will also have the opportunity to go down to the basement, where the space is arranged to allow training, with an area for film processing, a work bench and a small thematic library. Cristiano Pereira hopes the workshops will start as soon as January, resulting in the successful projects finishing to be displayed upstairs.
