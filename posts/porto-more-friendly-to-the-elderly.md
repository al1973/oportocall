Â  Source: [ICBAS helps to construct a Porto more friendly to the elderly](http://noticias.up.pt/icbas-ajuda-a-construir-um-porto-mais-amigo-dos-idosos/) [The Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute](https://sigarra.up.pt/icbas/pt/web_page.inicial) (ICBAS) at the University of Porto, the city council and the Polytechnic of Porto are organizing, from next February 18, a series of public workshops aimed at laying the foundation for building a more friendly city for the elderly. As part of the [Global Network of Age-friendly Cities and Communities](https://extranet.who.int/agefriendlyworld/about-us/), which Porto joined in 2010, the initiative will further the work that has been carried out by the city under the Project _Porto, Cidade Amiga das Pessoas Idosas_. To this end, citizens and institutions are invited to come together to reflect on specific themes that address active aging and the implementation of inter-generational activities in order to create a supportive, active and cohesive city based on a sustainable development path. The first workshop will have the theme "Porto, a city friendly to the elderly - Outside Spaces, Buildings and Housing". Five more sessions will focus on "Respect and Social Inclusion" (March 3), "Social Participation, Civic Participation and Employment" (March 17), "Communication and Information" (March 31), "Community Support and Health Services" (April 14) and "Transport"(April 28). The workshops take place between 14:30 and 16:30 in the City Hall. Participation is free but requires prior registration by e-mail dmds@cm-porto.pt or via phone 22 589 92 60.
