The guide, with a vintage look, features more than a hundred wine tours from nineteenth-century palaces to boutique hotels and century-old farm houses. It is not merely a list, the author explains the characteristics of each region and its wines, tells a brief story about each winery, and suggests some of the wines to taste in each one. It offers ideas for the best places to eat and sleep in each region and a short explanation of the main Portuguese grape varieties.
