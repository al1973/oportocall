The [Cantinho das Aromáticas](http://www.cantinhodasaromaticas.pt/) will distribute, from April 2016, organic food baskets containing products from Portugal's network of associations for the maintenance of local agriculture (AMAP). It is a model that reinvents the relationship between consumers and producers through the creation of socially responsible food systems that are economically viable and environmentally sustainable. Member producers of the AMAP include: [Quinta de Silvares](https://www.facebook.com/quintasilvares), [Pão Nosso](https://www.facebook.com/P%C3%A3o-Nosso-165185436864461/timeline), FungiFresh, [Canteiro dos Carvalhos](https://www.facebook.com/ocanteirodoscarvalhos/), [Agrinemus](https://www.facebook.com/agrinemus.produtosbiologicos), and Cantinho das Aromáticas. Products can be collected on Saturdays between 15.00 and 17.30, from the Cantinho das Aromáticas, Rua do Meiral, 508, Vila Nova de Gaia. For more information contact the Moving Cause Association - the local promoter of AMAP in Vila Nova de Gaia.
