In anticipation of the arrival of Spring, Porto will transform itself into the city of Camellias. Between the 5th and 12th of March there will be a week of activities celebrating the Camellia, now considered part of the cultural and natural heritage of Porto. The organization of the _XXI Exhibition of Camellias of Porto_, on the 5th and 6th of March, in the _Casa de Serralves_, is a joint initiative of the City of Porto and the Portuguese Association of Camellias. The diary of events includes much more than the exhibition; there will be in excess of 40 public events including guided visits, workshops, concerts, talks, conferences, tastings and many street activities. For the exhibition, the doors will open at 2.30 pm on the 5th and continue until 6 pm the following day. The theme is "Porto open to the world. Challenges of the 21st century in the 21st exhibition". The best Camellias will be chosen, there will be a market and performances of the _Theater of Japanese Shadows_ by the artist _Beniko Taneka_. Away from the exhibition at _Serralves_, the _Igreja dos Clérigos_ will host a concert by the _Orchestra of the Conservatory of Music Calouste Gulbenkian of Braga_, entitled "Sinfonia com Camélias", at 9.30 pm on the 5th of March. On Friday the 4th, the _Torre dos Clérigos_ will be center stage at 9 pm with a light show, dancing and an operatic performance. Other cross cultural events include Japanese shadow puppets at the _Palácio do Bolhão_, silk painting at the _Museu Nacional Soares dos Reis_, and a Vietnamese lantern festival, culminating with the launch of 130 lanterns, decorated with camellias, over the lake in the Jardim da Cordoaria. To close the festivities, _Praça General Humberto Delgado_ will host a party on Saturday afternoon entitled "Flower Power".
