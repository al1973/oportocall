The _Atelier Joaquim Pombal_ is a studio created in 1985 in _Leça do Balio_ by the ceramic artist. Here he produces traditional hand-painted Portuguese tiles (azulejos). In addition the workshop facilitates the complete tile manufacturing process, the creation of ceramic murals and large-scale restoration projects. Harnessing the great potential of the Portuguese tile tradition, the studio is involved in theoretical research and practices in restoration and replica production. There is a gallery with a permanent exhibition including examples of different styles and techniques as well as contemporary "azulejo" ceramic sculpture. The studio has developed as a learning space and offers various courses and demonstrations for beginners and the more experienced, in areas such as: tile making techniques, ceramic murals, theory, ceramic sculpture, high temperature firing of tiles, and external training is also available. more information : [https://www.facebook.com/PomardoPombal/](https://www.facebook.com/PomardoPombal/) [http://joaquimpombal.blogspot.com/](http://joaquimpombal.blogspot.com/)
