The _Centro Lúdico da Imagem Animada_ CLIA is a recreational and educational initiative that develops various types of activities centered on the animated image. It is aimed at children as well as adults, anyone who is receptive to playful experimentation with the endless possibilities of the moving image. The center now has a new space provided by the City of Porto. It is attached to the _Casa Tait_ and provides to the public an interactive experience including: contact with the educational processes and research associated with the creation of films, participation in film-making activities, and other forms of training. There is also a collection of over 150 films made by children, young people and adults, which are free to view by the public. It is located at _Rua de Entre Quintas, 219_ and opens Monday to Friday from 9.30 to 12.30 and 2 to 6 pm.
