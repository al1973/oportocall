The city of Porto will attempt to sell by public auction, on 16th February, the _Palacete Pinto Leite_. The asking price is €1.55 million. A stipulation of the sale is that the building be used for cultural, artistic or related ends. The mansion, originally known as _Casa do Campo Pequeno_, is situated on _Rua da Maternidade_ in Porto, is a nineteenth century residence built by Joaquim Pinto Leite, of the a wealthy Porto family. In 1966 the property was purchased by the city of Porto to be used as a music conservatory, but the house has been vacant since 2008. The Pinto Leite family were one of the most influential of Porto and Portugal in the mid nineteenth century. They played a fundamental role in the city and were linked to big business and high finance, having been one of the few Porto families with commercial branches in England. The mansion, also known as the _Casa do Campo Pequeno_, is one of the remaining signs of this economic strength. The site of the "palace" was originally known as Campo Pequeno, sharing walls with the nearby maternity hospital in a residential area popular with the British and referred to by the Porto writer _Júlio Dinis_ in his book _Uma Família Inglesa_ (An English Family). It was then surrounded by farmland and estates, and was acquired by Joaquim Pinto Leite in 1854. The designer is unknown for sure but possibly was an English architect, it was a unique building in Porto at the time and considered one of the most beautiful and rich of the city. The current appearance of the house is in great part due to modifications made by the children of Joaquim Pinto Leite at the beginning of the twentieth century, making it a little less restrained and more in tune with the other large houses of the city at the time, slightly diluting its original singular character.
