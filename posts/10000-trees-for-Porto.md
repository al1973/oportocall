*If you have a garden, we have a tree for you*, is the theme of a new initiative in the Porto area. In the next 5 years more than 10,000 native trees and shrubs will be planted in gardens and private grounds around the city. The trees are being produced in the Municipal Nursery as part of a bigger project which itself is attempting to plant 100,000 new trees in the Porto metropolitan area. 

The initiative will provide up to 10 trees and shrubs to each private garden, and the city also has plans to create tree tours of Porto. The application process to obtain trees is open until March 20, with 11 species available. The larger project,  [O Futuro - projeto das 100,000 árvores na Área Metropolitana do Porto](http://www.100milarvores.pt), has an objective to create and maintain urban forests comprised of native species. The hope is to replant an area of 100 hectares with 100,000 trees and shrubs, while at the same time educating citizens about the importance of native flora. The choice of species will depend on the ecological characteristics of each site. 

The preferred trees are oak, cork, alder, ash, laurel, arbutus, elm, stone pine, willow and hawthorn. Around 80% of the trees are provided through the initiative _[Floresta Comum](http://www.florestacomum.org/)_. The project was formed as an initiatve of the _Centro Regional de Excelência em Educação para o Desenvolvimento Sustentável da Área Metropolitana do Porto_ ([CRE.Porto](https://www.facebook.com/cre.porto)) and coordinated by the [Metropolitan Area of Porto](http://portal.amp.pt/pt/) and the [Catholic University Portugal (Porto)](http://www.porto.ucp.pt/en), with the participation of many public and private initiatives.
